Crime is essentially an act that is punishable by law. It doesn’t occur owing to a single cause but is an extremely complex happening that is influenced by the culture of the place in which it takes place. For the same reason, many activities that are deemed illegal in one country are legal in another. A case in point would be alcohol consumption which is illegal in Muslim countries but legal everywhere else. With changes in culture, people’s outlook towards what constitutes crime changes too. Owing to this, there can be various causes of crime that change based on the nature of the crime, the time and place of its occurrence, and the like.  As a result, criminalization and decriminalization of various phenomena is an ongoing process.
